TET - MOOC DevOps
==================

Main Changes:

* Changed the ubuntu version for an available one.
* Replaced the checksum for the correct one given in the mirror.
* Added a new vagrant file in a new folder devops-intro-project/packer-templates/vbx2/

NOTE: This new file was created because I didn't had access to AWS (Credit Card problem) so I changed the VagrantFile and I generated a .box
compatible with VirtualBox. I deployed everything in Virtualbox.
